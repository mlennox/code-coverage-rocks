# Code coverage rocks
Small example of how code coverage highlights insufficient unit testing

## Installation
The repo was created with Node.js version 10.15.1, the latest LTS version should be sufficient. Just run `npm install` to prepare the project. The code provided here is not intended to do anything, it is just an example, so run the test and code coverage using

```javascript
npm test
```

The coverage results are output to the `coverage` folder and you can see the html summary report at `coverage/lcov-report/index.html` which should open locally in your browser.
